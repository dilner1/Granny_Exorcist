<font size="4">

People do not have as much hope and optimism as they once did.

The bad vibes are manifesting themselves as evil spirits and soon ...... 

They will spill out into our plane of existence.

But all hope is not lost.

There is one person who can save us ..

A hero of an age long past.. the 1960's.

With the ultimate power of love and happiness.

Only she can thwart this great evil.....

She is....

## Deployment

This game is build for the Retro Game Hackathon of Code Institute. 

The basis is of the retro game Space Invader. <br>
Instead of killing we decided to make it a positive game, by shooting love / hearts.

See the live website here -> [Granny Exorsist](https://dilner1.github.io/Hackathon_Game_new/)
